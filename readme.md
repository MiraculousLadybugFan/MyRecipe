Here is how to make Red Velvet Cake because people at home don't know how to make one and are lazy. (deal with it reader noobs)
Here is some info that I stole from websites about Red Velvet Cake. (You can't use any powers on me noobs as I am a #girlboss)
Info I stole: 
Oxford: A rich cocoa-flavored cake with a distinctive reddish color, typically prepared as a layer cake with buttercream or cream cheese icing.
Wikipedia the trashy website: Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, red-brown, crimson, or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered with ermine icing. Traditional recipes do not use food coloring, with the red color due to non-Dutched, anthocyanin-rich cocoa. Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, vinegar, and flour.

Now lets do the recipe before I commit arson on toetanic.
